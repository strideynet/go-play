# go-play

A varied collection of my experiments with Go, in an attempt to evaluate the positives and negatives of multiple ways
of implementing basic concepts, such as broadcasting a message.

I will tend to lean quite heavily on demonstrating concepts within the context of a GRPC service, as I feel this provides
a very real-world connection to what would otherwise be a quite abstract piece of code.
